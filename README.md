# Procedural Modeling Project
This is a repository where you can find the final project of Lab Basic Graphics. 

The idea: 
- Implement a procedural modeling program.
- Automatic generation of furniture layouts in rooms.

## Modeling
1. Define a procedural grammar suitable for describing a room (including windows, doors, ...).
2. Define the data structure for grammar and geometry (tree structure).
3. Parse a grammar file of such a procedural description.
4. Apply procedural rules, generate room geometry and store it into the data structure.
5. Output the result (write into specific file format suitable for storing meshes with materials).

[Optional] Pass the intermediate result to renderer.
