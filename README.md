# Procedural Modeling Project
This is a repository where you can find the final project of Lab Basic Graphics. 

**This project only has the first part of three. It has a small visualization to show the results of the modeling.**

The idea: 
- Implement a procedural modeling program.
- Automatic generation of furniture layouts in rooms.

## Modeling
1. Define a procedural grammar suitable for describing a room (including windows, doors, ...).
2. Define the data structure for grammar and geometry (tree structure).
3. Parse a grammar file of such a procedural description.
4. Apply procedural rules, generate room geometry and store it into the data structure.
5. Pass the intermediate result to renderer.

[Optional] Output the result (write into specific file format suitable for storing meshes with materials).

[Optional] Generate the render with some objects (chair, sofa, table...)
